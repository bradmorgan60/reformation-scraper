# reformation-scraper
This is a webscraping tool designed to let me know what beers are on tap in all of the Reformation locations. The results are extracted into a CSV file and
sorted based on alcohol by volumne (ABV). The purpose of this project is to learn about webscraping, develop skills in Node.js, and learn about beer.
